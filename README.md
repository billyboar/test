# Developer Test

Please fork the repo and complete the tests cases in `server_test.go`. Once
completed, please request a Pull Request with your solution.

The test cases must be able to be run using the standard `go test` command. The
only external package that maybe used is `github.com/labstack/echo` for
route/server handling. All other packages must be part of the core Golang
language.
